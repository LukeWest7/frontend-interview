Thank you for the opportunity to show you what I can do.

I had an issue with loading the fixture avatar (within the modal), probably something to my local settings.'
I have tested that it's in a circle shape with test images and all is well.

Tasks below:

- Removing the border right on last item on each fixture
- Format the date and currency
- Fetch data from api - does load more, but not how you wanted it to work. Instead of fetching the next page, it loads all the data at once, but slices the first 5 and then on click I use a state to then add another 5.
- Created custom modal component and displayed the data (Run out of time, so it's not formatted/displayed exactly the same as the design)

Haven't installed cypress to do tests which I'm annoyed about, but I hope what I have is enough.

All done with Atomic Design Methodology which I'm a big fan of. Enjoy!

Thanks,

Luke West
